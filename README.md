# F1005B 🏎️
Final project from Tec de Monterrey's B.S. in Computer Science and Technology F1005B course: Computational Modeling Applying Conservation Laws.

This course was imparted in Spanish, therefore the source code has comments written in this language and the final report is written in Spanish as well.

The project is designed for teamwork and therefore this repo is the result of a collaboration among 5 students (myself included). All collaborators can be found in the coverpage of the report.
